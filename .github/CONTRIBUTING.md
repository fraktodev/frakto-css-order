# Contributing to Frakto CSS Order

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project — your input helps make it better for everyone!

**Frakto CSS Order** defines a logical categorization and order for all CSS properties, inspired by browser rendering phases, developer experience, and best practices. If you'd like to contribute, please read the following guidelines.

## Philosophy

Every contribution should aim to preserve the clarity, predictability, and maintainability of the transformation pipeline. Code must be written with long-term extensibility in mind, following consistent patterns and strict syntax rules.

We aim to maintain:

- **Simplicity:** The structure should be easy to understand and use.
- **Clarity:** Categories and order must be logically explained and consistently applied.
- **Practicality:** This order should feel intuitive to real developers writing real CSS.
