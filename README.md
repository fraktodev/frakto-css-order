# Frakto CSS Order

Frakto CSS Order is a thoughtfully crafted guide to ordering CSS properties based on logical grouping, real-world usage, and the browser’s rendering flow. Instead of relying on arbitrary or alphabetical sorting, this structure prioritizes readability, maintainability, and performance — helping developers write cleaner, faster, and more intuitive stylesheets.

## Why

Most CSS sorters follow alphabetical, SMACSS, or arbitrary schemes. `frakto-css-order` redefines that. It's crafted around:

- **Rendering Tree Logic** – Inspired by how browsers parse and apply styles.
- **Developer Experience** – Easier to read, write, and maintain.
- **Compression Efficiency** – Related properties stay together, reducing redundancy.

## Categories

### 1. Positioning

Defines the spatial placement of elements in the document flow, including stacking context, offsets, and flow disruptions.

### 2. Box Model

Controls the physical dimensions of elements, including sizing, padding, and margins — everything that affects how a box occupies space.

### 3. Layout

Manages how child elements are arranged within a parent, including layout systems like Flexbox, Grid, and multi-column flows.

### 4. Typography

Handles everything related to text: font settings, spacing, alignment, rendering, punctuation, and writing direction.

### 5. Visual

Affects the visual appearance of elements — background, borders, shadows, opacity, masks, and visibility. This is what users "see".

### 6. Transform

Covers transforms, transitions, and animations — any visual changes over time or space, including scaling, rotation, and motion.

### 7. Interaction

Defines how elements respond to user interaction and device input. Includes scroll behavior, pointer interaction, selection, and overflow.

### 8. Miscellaneous

A catch-all category for properties that don't fit elsewhere — including counters, content injection, printing, and global resets.
